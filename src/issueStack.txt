1) i want to use customer service class so that vip and regular customer dont' directly access menu services

2) i want a universal authenticator but it is clashing with my idea of customer service class

3) orderitem to be implemented
4) if we pass customerService as an argument in constructor, then in data initiliser class we have to pass this too many times, and how will we even pass it?
and everytime i create a user during runtime, how would this work then?
5) how to correctly use menuService and customerService
6) whether menuservice should also be a global(like only one instance for all functions)
